This is the dotfiles when hosting a Linux box on OSX
====================================================

Notes
-----

* Install vbox guest additions
* Make sure it's the same version as the host vbox
* Install all X11 libraries
* Install xrandr as well
* Create a config file using X command line
* Make sure the Decive driver is vboxvideo
* Use urxvt
* Make sure to install urxvt-perls
* Use Mod1Mask (left opt) instead mod4. mod4 is command and osx is too stupid.
